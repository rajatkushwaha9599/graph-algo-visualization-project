# **WEB-APP/WEBSITE FOR VISUALIZATION OF GRAPH ALGORITHMS**


This is an intuitive web app which helps in visualizing various graph algorithms like dfs, bfs, dijkstra  alongwith the data structure used for their implementation.

The website can be opened through any web browser and the user can understand the visual working of various algorithms. The visualisation supports upto 30 nodes and 6 different algorithms which are = DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, A*, Floyd Warshall. The user can choose whether they want to use directed or undirected edges and can add weights if they want to. One can also choose the end node for the path finding algorithm. We have also implemented Data Structure visualization for DFS, BFS and Dijkstra algorithms.

The link for website is https://bd9e9.csb.app/ 

At 1st the user needs to enter the number of nodes to be visualized. 

In the 2nd Step choose the type of edges the users want i.e., directed or undirected and whether they want to keep them weighted or unweighted.

In the 3rd Step the users needs to choose the algorithm they want to implement.

In the next step enter the starting node and if the algorithm is a path finding algorithm enter the ending node as well. Then click on visualize to see the beautiful result.
